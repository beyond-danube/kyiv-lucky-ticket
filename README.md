Lucky ticket in public transport is a nice East European tradition. Tickets used to be printed and had 6-digit number. When sum of first 3 and last 3 digits is the same, ticket was considers lucky ðŸŽ‰.

Kyiv, Ukraine, now uses digital tickets in a format $$VFKHXV1U9, so it's unclear is it lucky ot not. We have found a way to check luck of digital era tickets, with the vibe of that nice tradition.
